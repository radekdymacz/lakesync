description: LakeSync — open-source local-first sync for the modern web.
---

LakeSync is an open-source local-first sync engine built in TypeScript. It keeps your application data in a local SQLite database and synchronises changes with a remote gateway using column-level last-writer-wins (LWW) conflict resolution.

## Key Features

- **Column-level LWW** — Conflicts are resolved per-column, not per-row, so concurrent edits to different fields never overwrite each other.
- **Offline-first** — The full dataset lives in local SQLite (via sql.js WASM). Changes are queued and pushed when connectivity returns.
- **Sync Rules** — Declarative bucket-based filtering with JWT claim references. Each client receives only the data they are authorised to see.
- **Hybrid Logical Clocks** — Every mutation is timestamped with a branded `HLCTimestamp` (48-bit wall clock + 16-bit counter) for causal ordering.
- **Result-based error handling** — Public APIs return `Result<T, E>` instead of throwing, making error paths explicit and composable.
- **Static export friendly** — The gateway runs on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects; the client SDK works in any browser or Node.js environment.
