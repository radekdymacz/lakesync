description: LakeSync — the universal sync engine for TypeScript apps.
---

LakeSync is an open-source sync engine for TypeScript apps. Right data, right time, doesn't matter where it lives. Your data lives in local SQLite, syncs through a lightweight gateway, and flushes to whichever backend fits your scale. Same client code, any backend. Works for web apps, AI agents, and everything in between.

## Three Backend Tiers

| Tier | Backend | Use case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Tier 1 — SQL** | Postgres, MySQL, RDS | Small/medium OLTP data, familiar tooling |
| **Tier 2 — Analytics** | BigQuery | Query-heavy OLAP workloads, managed analytics |
| **Tier 3 — Data Lake** | S3/R2 via Apache Iceberg | Massive scale, zero ETL, open format |

The `LakeAdapter` and `DatabaseAdapter` interfaces abstract storage. Swap backends without changing client code.

## Key Features

- **Column-level LWW** — Conflicts are resolved per-column, not per-row, so concurrent edits to different fields never overwrite each other.
- **Offline-first** — The full dataset lives in local SQLite (via sql.js WASM). Changes are queued and pushed when connectivity returns.
- **Sync Rules** — Declarative bucket-based filtering with JWT claim references. Each client receives only the data they are authorised to see.
- **Hybrid Logical Clocks** — Every mutation is timestamped with a branded `HLCTimestamp` (48-bit wall clock + 16-bit counter) for causal ordering.
- **Result-based error handling** — Public APIs return `Result<T, E>` instead of throwing, making error paths explicit and composable.
- **Pluggable adapters** — Postgres, MySQL, BigQuery, S3/R2, or anything else. The gateway flushes through adapter interfaces.
