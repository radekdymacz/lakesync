# LakeSync Dashboard — Environment Configuration
#
# Two modes:
#
# 1. DEV MODE (default — no keys needed)
#    Copy this file to .env.local and leave the Clerk keys commented out.
#    The dashboard runs with mock data — fully functional, no auth.
#
# 2. CLERK MODE (real auth)
#    Create a free Clerk app at https://dashboard.clerk.com
#    IMPORTANT: Enable "Organizations" in your Clerk dashboard
#    (Settings → Organizations → Enable)
#    Copy the publishable key (pk_test_...) and secret key (sk_test_...)
#    below and uncomment them.
